### ðŸ§® Level 2 â€“ Task 1: Simple Calculator

This project is a responsive and user-friendly **calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It performs the four basic arithmetic operations â€” **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** â€” through a clean and intuitive interface.

ðŸ§  Key Skills Applied:
- DOM manipulation for dynamic user interaction
- Writing logical and reusable JavaScript functions
- Styling a minimal, responsive layout for better usability

ðŸ§° This task helped me sharpen my front-end development skills by combining logic, interactivity, and design into a practical web tool.
