### 🕊️ Level 2 – Task 2: Tribute Page

This project is a heartfelt tribute to the legendary **Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam**, honoring his remarkable journey, visionary achievements, and timeless words of inspiration.

🛠️ Built using **semantic HTML** and **elegant CSS**, the page is structured to be clean, readable, and accessible — reflecting both respect for the subject and attention to good web design practices.

📚 Through this project, I learned:
- How to organize meaningful content in a visually appealing layout
- The importance of semantic tags for structure and accessibility
- The power of combining emotion with design to connect with viewers

🙏 This page is not only a technical milestone but also a personal salute to one of India’s most admired leaders and thinkers.
