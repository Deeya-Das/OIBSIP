## ðŸ’¼ Internship Experience

During this virtual internship, I got the opportunity to work on multiple front-end web development projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It helped me strengthen my fundamentals, improve my design thinking, and gain hands-on experience in creating responsive and user-friendly web pages.

I also learned the importance of clean code structure, visual consistency, and effective use of GitHub for version control and project presentation.
