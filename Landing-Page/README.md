***Task 1:Drug Awareness Landing Page***

<p>A thoughtfully designed landing page aimed at raising awareness about the dangers of drug abuse.
Created using pure HTML and CSS, this project features a sleek, clean layout, informative content, and impactful visuals to communicate a strong social message.
It not only reflects my concern for real-world issues but also helped me sharpen my front-end design and layout skills through meaningful development.
