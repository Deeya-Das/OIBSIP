### 🧠 Level 1 – Task 1: Drug Awareness Landing Page

This project is a thoughtfully crafted landing page created as part of **Level 1** of my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. Built using **pure HTML and CSS**, it encourages visitors to join a campaign focused on spreading awareness about the importance of making informed, healthy life choices.

🧾 Key Features:
- Clean and impactful layout with a strong social message  
- Informative sections highlighting the purpose and call to action  
- Visual hierarchy and design elements that enhance readability and engagement  

🌍 More than just a technical task, this project reflects my concern for real-world issues. It allowed me to explore web design from both a creative and purposeful angle — combining visual storytelling with front-end skills.

✨ Through this, I enhanced my understanding of layout structure, visual composition, and the importance of message-driven web design.
