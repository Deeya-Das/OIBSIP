#Level 1<br>Task 1: Landing Page

***Drug Awareness Landing Page***

A thoughtfully designed landing page aimed at raising awareness about the dangers of drug abuse.<br>
Created using pure HTML and CSS, this project features a sleek, clean layout, informative content, and impactful visuals to communicate a strong social message.<br>
It not only reflects my concern for real-world issues but also helped me sharpen my front-end design and layout skills through meaningful development.
