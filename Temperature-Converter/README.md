### 🌡️ Level 1 – Task 3: Temperature Converter

This project is a simple yet functional **temperature converter** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to easily convert values between **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Kelvin** with a smooth and responsive interface.

🛠️ Key Concepts Practiced:
- Handling user input and form validation
- Implementing conversion logic with JavaScript
- Designing an intuitive and responsive UI layout

⚙️ This task helped me turn a basic utility idea into a usable mini web app, strengthening my confidence in working with interactive elements and client-side logic.
