***Task 2: Personal Portfolio Website***

This personal portfolio was created as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte. Built using HTML and CSS, it highlights my background, skills, and projects in a clean and structured layout. Working on this project helped me improve my understanding of responsive design, page structure, and how to present content effectively on the web.
