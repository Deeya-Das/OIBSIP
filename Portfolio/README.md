### ðŸ’¼ Level 1 â€“ Task 2: Personal Portfolio Website

As part of **Level 1** of my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**, I designed and developed a fully responsive personal portfolio website using **HTML** and **CSS**.

ðŸŽ¯ The goal of this project was to build a digital space that reflects my identity as a web developer â€” highlighting my bio, technical skills, and featured projects in a visually clean and structured format.

ðŸ’¡ What I learned:
- Crafting responsive layouts for multiple devices
- Structuring content with semantic HTML
- Enhancing visual appeal through thoughtful CSS styling

âœ¨ This project not only improved my front-end skills but also taught me how to present myself professionally on the web. It serves as a foundation for my personal brand and a growing showcase of my journey in tech.
